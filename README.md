# Crime-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This exploratory data analysis examines a crime dataset ("Crime1.csv") containing variables such as **Category**, **Description**, **DayOfWeek**, and **PdDistrict**. The aim is to uncover patterns in crime types, timing, and geographic distribution using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and WordCloud.

The most common crimes include *Larceny/Theft*, *Other Offenses*, and *Non-Criminal*, following a right-skewed (Pareto-like) distribution, where a few categories dominate total incidents. Word clouds and bar plots effectively visualize the frequency of both crime categories and descriptions, highlighting repeated terms like "BATTERY" and "ASSAULT." Analysis of the **DayOfWeek** shows a relatively uniform distribution of crimes, with slight mid-week increases, suggesting consistent policing needs.

Spatially, districts such as *SOUTHERN*, *MISSION*, and *NORTHERN* record the highest crime counts, indicating urban hotspots likely tied to population density and economic activity. These patterns are visualized using bar charts for intuitive understanding.

In summary, the study identifies significant patterns in crime type, time, and location, offering insights for targeted law enforcement. The findings provide a foundation for further modeling and strategic decision-making in crime prevention and urban safety planning.
